Daypage - Web Journaling that doesn't hurt.

==About==

Daypage is an app for keeping notes for each day. It's kind of like a journal, ledger, diary, or a lot of other names for record-keeping items. I plan on using it to track hours spent on different projects. I think it will be easier to track and remember these things looking back when they are organized by date.

Daypage runs on Google Appengine
