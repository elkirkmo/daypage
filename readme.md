Daypage - Web Journaling that doesn't hurt.

## About

[Daypage](http://www.daypager.com/) is an app for keeping notes for
each day. It's kind of like a journal, ledger, diary, or a lot of
other names for record-keeping items. I plan on using it to track
hours spent on different projects. I think it will be easier to track
and remember these things looking back when they are organized by
date.

Daypage runs on Google Appengine
