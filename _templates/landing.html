<h4>Improve My Life?</h4>
    <p>Daypage helps you keep notes for every day. It is a journal, ledger, diary, log, and/or record keeper. It is inspired by Evernote and Github. I wanted to combine the remember everything aspect of Evernote with the looking back at progress and motivation of Github.</p>
    <p>I have used it every single day since I created it and have become more organized and more date-aware.</p>
