    <h3>Hi There!</h3>
    <p>Sign in to get started, it's super fast and easy.</p>
    <p>Daypage is an app for keeping notes for each day. It's kind of like a journal, ledger, diary, or a lot of other names for record keeping items. I plan on using it to track hours spent on different projects. I think it will be easier to track and remember these things looking back when they are organized by date.</p>
    <p>Daypage is open source! <a href="https://github.com/sponrad/daypage" target="_blank">Github</a></p>
    <p>Daypage runs on Google Appengine</p>
    <p>I started coding Daypage on February 28, 2013</p>
