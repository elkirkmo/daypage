    <h4>Daypage Can Improve Your Life</h4>
    <p>Daypage helps you write and keep notes every day. It is a journal, ledger, diary, log, notebook and a lot of other things. It is inspired by Evernote, Github, Instagram, and Reddit (and recently 750words). I want to combine the remember-everything aspect of Evernote with the looking back at progress and motivation of Github (and 750words), mingled with some of the social fun of the others.</p>
    <p>Daypage is simple, just a blank page you can type in attached to a date. It is also complex with a great tagging system, full-text search, personal writing statistics, todos, and some social sharing options. Of course all of this stays out of your way so that at its heart it is just a blank page and a date.</p>
    <p>I have used it every single day since I created it and have become more organized and more date-aware. What do I mean by date aware? I mean that I am aware of my status on all the stuff I need to do in respect to when I want it done and what day I am currently at.</p>

    <h4>More Information</h4>
    <p>Daypage is open source! <a href="https://github.com/sponrad/daypage" target="_blank">Github</a></p>
    <p>Daypage runs on Google Appengine (though I may switch to pure Django) and also uses, jQuery, jQuery UI, and Zurb Foundation, along with a few other jQuery libraries.</p>
    <p>I started coding Daypage on February 28, 2013. It went live that weekend and I have used it every day since, it will definitely receive updates.</p>
